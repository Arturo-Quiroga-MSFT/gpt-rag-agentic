   - **Construct the  Transact-SQL (T-SQL) query using the correct table(s) and column names provided.**
   - **If multiple tables are required, ensure proper JOIN operations (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) are used based on relationships between the tables.**
   - **Do not combine `DISTINCT` with `TOP` in the same query, and avoid using reserved words like 'EQ', 'DO', 'IN', 'AS', 'BY', 'OR', 'ON' when renaming tables.**
   - **Ensure that the query meets the user's request accurately and reflects the necessary information from the involved tables.**
   - **Use the `LIKE` operator with `LOWER` for case-insensitive searches, with wildcard characters `%` and `_`.**
